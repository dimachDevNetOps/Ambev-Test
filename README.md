# Ambev-DevOps_Challenges not 
Hello I'm Diego Machado and I created this Repository to answer all Ambev DevOps_Challeges! 
<p>We're here for tech and beer<span>&#127866;</span></p>

# Propose:

This repo was created only with the propose to answer the test challege for the job opopportunity <b>DevOps Engineer</b>
<br>Upon the opportunity I decided to create a Architecture Drawing for each one of all the challenges</br>
 
# The Original Challenge Repo:
•	[AMBEV-DevOps_Challenges](https://github.com/cervejaria-ambev/DevOps_Challenges/)

# The Challenges:
<br>•	[DevOps Engineer](https://github.com/cervejaria-ambev/DevOps_Challenges/blob/master/devops.md)</br>
•	[DBA](https://github.com/cervejaria-ambev/DevOps_Challenges/blob/master/dbre.md)
<br>•	[SRE](https://github.com/cervejaria-ambev/DevOps_Challenges/blob/master/sre.md)</br>
•	[DevSecOps Engineer](https://github.com/cervejaria-ambev/DevOps_Challenges/blob/master/devsecops.md)</br>



# 1º Architecture Design Drawing - DevOps Engineer

<span>&#10042;</span>  Architecture Drawing :

Design Drawing Over the Challege to DevOps Engineer is linked over this Images bellow just click into the image to check the architecture!

Explanation of the Sructure Presented :

<br>• Use cloud-init to create an app to scale</br> 
• Create a virtual machine scale set
<br>• Fixed configuration to increase or decrease the number of instances in a scale set</br> 
• Create autoscale rules
<br>• View connection info for scale set instances</br> 
• Use data disks in a scale set

# Explanation

This list above would one of solution that will use for this challege, first Scale Set can support up to 1,000 VMs when you use an Azure platform image or VM customization requirements, you may wish. You can create up to 300 VMs in a scale set when using a custom image. This solution will helps at peak times, when the disc is widely used degrading the performance  issues mention in the Challenge, I definitely inclued as well scale set with data disks, reates a scale set with 50Gb data disks attached to each instance, instead only 30 gb as was mention in the test, also only to give more performance.
